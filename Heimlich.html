            <p id="HeimlichP">Parents of young children know all too well that small objects and pieces of food can
                easily get
                lodged in the throat. This can cause choking, which closes off the airway. Big kids and adults are
                also at risk of choking. The Heimlich maneuver &nbsp;<a href="heimlich maneuver.mp3"><img src="th.png"
                        alt="" width="20px" height="20px"></a> is a tool used to help someone who is choking.</p>

                <p>According to the American Red Cross, if a person is unable to breathe, cough, speak, or cry, they are
                    likely choking. They may wave their arms above their head or point to their throat to indicate they
                    are
                    choking. They even may start to turn blue from lack of oxygen.</p>

                    <p>This technique is not safe for infants under 1 year old. Instead, place the infant on your
                        forearm or
                        thigh, make sure their head is supported, and hit their back with the palm of your hand until
                        the item

                        object.
                        This works better than trying to perform the thrusting motion on yourself.</p>

                    <li id="Y">Keep small and dangerous objects, like marbles and balloons, out of reach of children.</li>
