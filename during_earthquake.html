                        <li><b>DROP down onto your hands and knees</b> before the earthquake knocks you down. This position
                            protects you from falling but allows you to still move if necessary.</li>
                        <li><b>COVER your head and neck</b> (and your entire body if possible) underneath a sturdy table or
                            desk. If there is no shelter nearby, get down near an interior wall or next to low-lying furniture
                            that wonâ€™t fall on you, and cover your head and neck with your arms and hands.</li>
                        <li><b>HOLD ON to your shelter</b> (or to your head and neck) until the shaking stops. Be prepared to
                            move with your shelter if the shaking shifts it around.</li>

                            hanging objects, bookcases, china cabinets, or other large furniture that could fall. </li>
